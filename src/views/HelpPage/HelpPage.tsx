                        your player Avatar, click "Avatar" in the top left of the play page. There
                        are five different species, and hundreds of options. Changing species
                        automatically changes planets as well. You can choose species from the bar
                        at top, and try different avatars by clicking the left and right arrows.
                        When you are happy with your avatar, click "Done - I love it!" This avatar
                        will load by default next time you use the server with the same device. You
                        can change your name without changing your avatar by clicking "Change Name".
                        You can change both your name and your avatar as often as you like.

                    <p>
                        You can choose your opponent on the game creation page. There are many skill
                        levels in Go, so you are encouraged to choose a handicap to play at so the
                        game is fair for both players. The Beginner Bot will automatically give you
                        4 stones to start out with. Weak Bot gives two stones, and Easy Bot plays
                        even. You can change how many handicaps you want to play with at the bottom
                        of the screen. You can also change color if you want to be white, or give
                        your opponent a handicap. In general, if a player wins all the time, they
                        should give a handicap to the other player. Consider one stone for every 7
                        points, so if you win by 21 points you could try giving a 3 stone handicap.
                        It will take a few games with a player to see what the right handicap should
                        be. If you don’t know, just play even. If someone wins 2 or more times,
                        adjust the handicap.

                    <p>
                        To end the game, you must pass. Two passes in a row end the game. The pass
                        button is at the bottom right during a game. If you can’t capture anything,
                        and you can only fill your own territory, you should pass. Spaces between
                        living groups are called neutral points. Neither player gets a point for
                        these, but you must fill them in to end the game. If you play in your own
                        territory, and the other player takes a neutral point, you actually lose one
                        point. You get points for the empty space, not the full space. You can also
                        resign a game to end it at any point, and the bots will often resign when
                        you are winning.

                    <h2>Scoring the Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        In an even game, starting is a big advantage. To make it fair, blue has to
                        pay white 7.5 points at the start of the game. This is called Komi. In a
                        handicap game komi is half a point. We use this to break ties, so white
                        always wins ties because of the half point. Reading the score can be
                        confusing, and if you didn’t surround and capture stones that can’t survive
                        in your territory, they won’t be added to your total. So remember to capture
                        everything you can. If you want to look at the board after the game, click
                        view game. The little squares represent territory - white or blue. If you
                        want to look at the score again, click show score. Your score is the total
                        of your territory, plus komi, minus any prisoners you lost. When you are
                        done, click play again to return to the main playing area. This does not
                        start a new game. You must start a game with another player, or accept a
                        challenge, in order to play a new game.

                        you can play. If there are no kids to play, you can wait and see if someone
                        shows up, or you can play a bot. Players who are in a game do not show up on
